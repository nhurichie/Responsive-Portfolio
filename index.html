                my name is nhu richie.  i am a vietnamese adoptee from minneapolis, minnesota.  i am inquisitive to a fault, have a persistent desire to learn, and am genuinely curious for why things are they way they are.  i would like to think i am a hard worker but i do try not to take myself too seriously. i am also quite short and a terrible basketball player.  what a useless stump. what i lack in dribbling and free-throw skills though, i more than make up for my bodacious smile and personality.  i'd like to think that i am a lover of love, a storyteller, and a random fact monger. when i'm not just lounging around on a sunday morning eating pancakes, i like to explore the spirit of fun by tackling the country be it on bike or foot; adventuring outdoors; attemting to climb rocks; eating a plain raised glazed doughnut from bogart's doughtnuts (hands down the best in the twin cities!); and getting my face lost in a stack of books.  besides relishing in the things i enjoy day-by-day, there are things i am passionate about that are outside of me.  one of them is pushing the less social media, more social justice movement.
